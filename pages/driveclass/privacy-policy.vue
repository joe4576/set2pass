    </p>
    <p>

      why we collect it, and what we do with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you choose to use the Service, then you agree to the collection and use
      of information in relation to this policy. The Personal Information that

    <p class="font-weight-bold">Why do we request the LOCATION permission?</p>
    <p>
      As you know, the Service is a map and track application. We use location
      data so that you can see your location on the map. This information is
      stored only on the saved track files on your device.
    </p>
    <p class="font-weight-bold">Information Collection, Use and Sharing</p>
    <p>
      The location information that we request is retained on your device and is
      not distributed by us in any way.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Service does not require an Internet connection and Cookies are
      neither requested by the Service nor stored by the Service on your device.
    </p>
    <p class="font-weight-bold">Security</p>
    <p>
      No Personal Information is stored by the Service apart from the saved
      track files. These stored track files are not encrypted in any way. Should
      you decide to share these via any of the available transmission services
      on your device, you should be advised that no method of electronic
      transmission or storage is 100% secure and reliable, and we therefore
      cannot guarantee any form of security.
