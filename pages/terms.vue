  <text-page title="Terms and Conditions">
    <p>
      The following terms and conditions apply to any individual taking driver
      training with Set2Pass Driving School or any of its
      trainers/subcontractors:
    </p>
    <p>
      'Student' or 'the driver' refers to the individual receiving driver
      training.
    </p>
    <p>
      'ADI' or 'PDI' or 'Instructor' refers to the individual licensed to
      deliver driving tuition.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you have any issues with the service or training, please do not
      hesitate to get in touch. Contact details can be found at the bottom of
      this document. If this does not resolve the issue, you can contact the
      DVSA directly. The DVSA is the regulatory body that governs ADIs and PDIs.
      Their contact details can be found, at the date of writing, at:
      https://www.gov.uk/contact-dvsa. This does not affect your statutory
      rights.
    </p>
    <p class="font-weight-bold">Driving Licences and Fitness to Drive</p>
    <p>
      The Student must provide the Instructor with a valid licence to drive in
      the UK before the commencement of their first driving lesson. If the
      Student fails to provide a valid licence, the Instructor will refuse to
      conduct the driving lesson and the lesson fee will be payable in full.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Student must be fit to drive and must disclose any relevant medical
      condition(s) that may affect their theory or practical test. This includes
      any relevant allergies or learning needs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Student must notify the Instructor of any matters that affect their
      ability or entitlement to have driving tuition, e.g. loss of a valid
      driving licence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Student must demonstrate that they can read a standard car number
      plate at a distance of 20.5 metres. Instructors will perform a roadside
      eyesight check; however, they reserve the right to request an optician to
      confirm that the Student's eyesight meets the requirements.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Student must inform the Instructor of any upcoming court hearings with
      regards to driving offences, including fixed penalties or driver awareness
      courses, before entering the vehicle.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Instructor reserves the right to cancel a lesson if it is suspected
      that the Student may be unfit to drive due to the effects of alcohol,
      drugs (prescribed or recreational) or any other conditions that would
      hinder the Student's ability to drive. The lesson fee will be payable in
      full.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the Instructor carries a breathalyser, the Student may be asked to
      provide a specimen of breath. Notwithstanding the previous points,
      judgements on the Student's condition will be made at the discretion of
      the Instructor. An alternative lesson on theory training, legal
      requirements, personal judgements and/or coping strategies may be offered
      in the place of a practical lesson, which is chargeable at the full rate.
    </p>
    <p class="font-weight-bold">Use of Private Vehicle</p>
    <p>
      The Instructor may agree to deliver training in a private (owned or
      operated by the Student) vehicle. It is the vehicle owner and Student's
      responsibility to make sure that all legalities are addressed. This
      includes, but is not limited to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          Insurance. Insurance must cover “paid for driving tuition” and, in the
          case of a test, “the driving test”. The journey after the test must
          also be covered. The Student should be able to provide evidence of the
          insurance policy.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          All vehicles must be safe and road legal. This will be assessed by the
          Instructor. If the vehicle is not deemed safe and road legal, the
          lesson will be postponed or cancelled and will be chargeable in full.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Points, fines or penalties will be the sole responsibility of the
          vehicle owner and/or Student. This could include loss of earnings,
          reputation or damages.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The Instructor will take reasonable measures to prevent damage to the
          Student's or third party's person or property. The Instructor has no
          liability to do so.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="font-weight-bold">Legal Responsibility</p>
    <p>
      The Student has the legal responsibility to ensure they are driving in
      accordance with the law. Tickets/penalties will be legally those of the
      Student, regardless of the licence status. The Instructor will take
      reasonable measures to ensure that the Student is aware of the law and if
      they are at risk of infringing it. The Instructor is legally obliged to
      report details of any Student on request. This does not affect your
      statutory rights.
    </p>
    <p class="font-weight-bold">Data Protection and Student Tracking</p>
    <p>
      Set2Pass will keep records including personal information, track Student
      progress and may use technology to do so. Set2Pass will take reasonable
      measures to ensure this data is protected. The Student can contact the
      Instructor to get a copy of all data held on them upon request. Each
      Instructor car is fitted with a dash cam that records outward-facing video
      but no audio.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your data will be held until it is no longer deemed relevant, at which
      point all data will be destroyed or deleted. The Student can request the
      Instructor to destroy data at any point.
    </p>
    <p>
      Set2Pass may use photographs and Student testimonials on Set2Pass' public
      Facebook page for the purposes of promotion. This usage will be agreed
      with the Student.
    </p>
    <p class="font-weight-bold">Passengers</p>
    <p>
      When safe to do so, and at the Instructor's discretion, a passenger will
      be welcome.
    </p>
    <p class="font-weight-bold">Personal Property</p>
    <p>
      Set2Pass accepts no liability for Student's personal property that is left
      in any training vehicle.
    </p>
    <p class="font-weight-bold">Mobile Phones</p>
    <p>
      For safety reasons, Students should ensure that mobile phones are switched
      off / in flight-safe mode prior to entering the tuition vehicle. UK Law
      prohibits the use of mobile phones whilst driving.
    </p>
    <p class="font-weight-bold">Bookings</p>
    <p>
      Bookings are made as an agreement between the individual Instructor and
      Student. Payments will be made between Students and Instructors. Refunds
      can be discussed with the Instructor.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the event of mechanical breakdown or other difficulty outside the
      control of the Instructor, the Instructor reserves the right to rearrange
      lessons at short notice.
    </p>
    <p class="font-weight-bold">Payments and Cancellations</p>
    <p>
      Payments will be made before each session, unless agreed otherwise with
      the Instructor. Payment via a bank transfer is preferred. Cheques will not
      be accepted unless there is an agreement with the Instructor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cancellations must be given within 48 hours of the appointed lesson slot.
      The Student will still have to pay for the lesson if notice is given in
      any amount of time less than 48 hours.
    </p>
    <p class="font-weight-bold">Practical Tests</p>
    <p>
      The standard hourly rate will apply when Students are taking their
      practical test. Set2Pass cannot be held responsible for any loss or
      perceived loss in the event of a cancelled test.
    </p>
    <p class="font-weight-bold">COVID-19</p>
    <p>Set2Pass complies with DVSA COVID-19 safety guidelines by:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Sanitising all controls, door handles and relevant surfaces</p>
      </li>
      <li><p>Sanitising hands before and after each lesson</p></li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Wearing required PPE (unless not required due to special
          circumstances)
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Rolling down windows to maximise airflow.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Any Student displaying signs of illness will not be allowed to enter the
      tuition vehicle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Set2Pass will not be held responsible or liable should anyone become
      infected following a driving lesson.
